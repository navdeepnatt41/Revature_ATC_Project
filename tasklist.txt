Flight Operations Manager:

1. - update if a flight is delayed, and by how much
    - update flight.flight_status
    - update flight.delay_delta

2. schedule new flight
    (a) make sure the aircraft is available at airport and isn't currently scheduled
    (b) make sure your flight crew (consisting of pilot, copilot, flight_m, flight_a)
        currently exist at an airport AND aren't scheduled
    2a. List all available aircraft at an airport at a given time
    2b. List all available in-flight employees for flight-crew creation

3. CRUD Routes
    3a. Create a Route
    3b. Getting all Routes
    3c. Deleting a Route (route: Route, authorization_code: Code)
        - ensure that auth code matches, then delete (cascade)
    3d. Propose Route Deletion
        - provide a list of flights that will be cancelled as a warning
        
4. Cancelling flights
    - flight status must be scheduled, NOTHING ELSE (mark aircraft+crew available)

5. Update aircraft for flight
         - take in parameter of aircraft_id (assume endpoint)
         - if aircraft not located at dept_airport, return error

Idea: when creating a flight crew, we filter for every employee at the origin airport
        - then loop through those and check if they 
        (a) are available (they're not on a flight),
if they (b) don't have a flight tomorrow or the day after (two day interval)
 
CRUD Stretch:
    Add CRUD for Airport, Aircraft, etc. ..
